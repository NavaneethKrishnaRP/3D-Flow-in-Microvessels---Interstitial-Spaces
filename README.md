# 3D-Flow-in-Microvessels-And-Interstitial-Spaces
We developed a bottom-up modeling approach using 3D image stacks of in vitro vascular networks. The model treats vessels and interstitial space as separate components with properties like permeability and porosity, and solves flow equations across the network, interstitium, and endothelium.
